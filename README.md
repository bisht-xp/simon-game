```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine.

## How to Play
The game will display a sequence of colors and play a sound for each color. Your goal is to repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will add another color to the sequence and you'll need to repeat the new, longer sequence.
